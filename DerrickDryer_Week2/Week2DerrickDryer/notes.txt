b) http://localhost/projects/Week2DerrickDryer/display_results.php?userId=Test&hourlySalary=50.00&hoursPerWeek=40&daysPerWeek=5&vacationPerYear=5&holidayPerYear=10
c) http://localhost/projects/Week2DerrickDryer/index.php
d) http://localhost/projects/Week2DerrickDryer/display_results.php
e) This is due to the requests being sent to and received directly to the server instead of the client. In order for it to fully work both the pages that need the values must utilize the same method.
f) The URL in step B utilized the URL to push the values to the display_results page.
g) The best advantage would be to make sure the values are working correctly and to make sure the variables are outputting into the correct data type.
h) Went back to using “get” method in your index.php and use INPUT_GET in the filter_inputs statements in display_results.php
i) The values will return back to string data types as that is the default form values take because the form took them in string form.
j) It is important to use FILTER_VALIDATE to make sure the values we are getting are the correct data type to make sure functions and other parts of the code work correctly. For example you you don't, adding two numbers will result in a string and not actual math.
k) Made sure to re-write the php code by including FILTER_VALIDATE_FLOAT for hourlySalary as you proceed with the rest of the assignment.

PART II
l) var_dump is helpful as it allows the programmer to make sure the variables are the correct data types. We care about this because math can be very literal and can cause errors when using the wrong ones. Such as addition, adding two strings has a different result than adding floats and int.
m) FILTER_VALIDATE_FLOAT converts the user inputted string from the form into a float. Both FILTER_VALIDATE_FLOAT & FILTER_VALIDATE_INT will convert the whatever strings were inputted into their respective data types.
n) _BOOL, _BOOLEAN, _DOMAIN, _EMAIL, _FLOAT, _INT, _IP, _MAC, _REGEXP, _URL can all be used for FILTER_VALIDATE.
o) DivisionByZeroError: It is an arithmetic error that can crash your code as computers are not able to handle divide by zero. Even in typical math you cannot divide by zero. It is important due to the errors it can cause. This can cause major errors and server crashing.

PART III
p) All the include method does is execute the code of the included file. It does not redirect, nor does it copy and paste the code into the current page. All it is doing is executing the code.
